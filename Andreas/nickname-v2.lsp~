;Nickname generator

;This contract is used to register a nickname with a ethereum address. The nick is registered
;at 0xADDRESS, and the address is registered at the address corresponding to the name string.
;There is a linked list system connecting user names, to make it possible to list all currently
;registered names.


; LINKED LIST MECHANICS
; 0x11 contains the size of the list.
; 0x12 contains a reference to the current tail.
; 0x13 contains a reference to the current head.
; 
; Each list element contains four addresses - the first one is the element address,
; which is based on the name. The second one is the address + 1, which contains a
; reference to the previous element. The third one is address + 2, which contains
; a reference to the head. The fourt one is at address - 1, and contains user level.
; Element:
; @@(name - 1) - Contains admin level.
; @@(name) - Contains user address.
; @@(name + 1) - Link to previous element (if any).
; @@(name + 2) - Link to next element (if any).

;API
;
;"reg" "name" - register nickname "name" to sender if possible
;"dereg" - deregister the nickname held by the caller (if any)
;"dereg" "name" - deregister the nickname "name". This is ADMIN ONLY, and can only be done to non-admin nicks.
;"promote" "name" - bump the user up 1 level. Nobody can promote a user beyond his own level.
;"protome" "name" - This bumps the nick holder up to the caller level, if caller is higher. protome = "promote to me"
;"kill" - kills the contract. Only callable by the creator.
