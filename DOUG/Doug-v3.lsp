;DOUG Version 3

;Transactions
;Register: Format: "reg" "name" (maybe name is hexadecimal?)
;DOUG will record name requested at the address of request and create a confirmation request of consensus contract
;When a concensus contract has reached criteria for a successful concensus (or maybe doug will ask everytime he is called)
;in either case once doug recieves the go ahead he will make the swap (this involves changing the address located at name)
;
;Request: Format: "req" "name"
;Request asks Doug for the contract address currently associated with "name" and doug will return it or return 0 if no such 
;name is registered.
;
;Fetch: Format: "fetch" #number
;Fetch will return the [name:Contract ID] pair for the item located in  
;
;when the upgrades name is empty Doug will by default accept all registrations

;Major structure change is that DOUG handles poll contracts himself in a linked list structure
;The reason for this is to reduce the risk caused by mallfunctioning poll or concensus contracts
;
;The structure of the linked list is as follows
;@0xPOLLADDRESS 0xCONTRACTADDRESS
;@0xPOLLADDRESS+1 0xNEXTPOLLADDRESS
;
;The reason for no previous pointer is because the list will always be searched in one direction so the previous pointer can be stored in memory
;
;The contract of interest now is "pollcodes" - Stores the code and creates poll contracts when requested and return poll address
;If a poll contract does not respond properly there needs to be some recovery mechanism
