;Nickname generator

;This contract is used to register a nickname with a ethereum address. The nick is registered
;at 0xADDRESS, and the address is registered at the address corresponding to the name string.
;There is a linked list system connecting user names, to make it possible to list all currently
;registered names.


; LINKED LIST MECHANICS
; 0x11 contains the size of the list.
; 0x12 contains a reference to the current tail.
; 0x13 contains a reference to the current head.
; 
; Each list element contains three addresses - the first one is the element address,
; which is based on the name. The second one is the address + 1, which contains a
; reference to the previous element. The third one is address + 2, which contains
; a reference to the head.

;API
;

;"getnick" address - returns the nick belonging to the provided address, if any.
