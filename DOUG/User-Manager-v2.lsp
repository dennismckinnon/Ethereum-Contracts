;User Permissions Manager

;This is a first generation permissions contract Its purpose is to return a value corresponding to the permissions an address has.
;The contract has three types of permissions, Normal members, Admins, and Super-Admins. The first two are distinguished by
;the permissions value they have at address [[userAddress]]. If the first bit is 1 then they have normal member priveleges
;if the second bit is a 1 then they have admin privileges. This contract assumes that if they are an admin they are also a normal
;member. However in general this is not necessary and in the future you can have more bits to represent other priveleges either
;for this contract of for others (once you design a secure API for other contract control of specific bits)

;The Admins have additional structure for them. Admins are placed in a list starting at address 0x20 and growing towards higher
;addresses. If you are lower on the list (or higher if you think of low addresses as being higher up) then you have power over
;admin located in the list at a higher address. (priority much like Reddit Mods). You can not affect an admin that has a lower
;position then you in the list. (You can affect up to and including your level so you can say replace yourself with another
;person lower down)

;A downside to maintaining this additional list structure is that order must be maintained at all times which requires 
;an excessive amount of looping in order to do so. Implementing a better linked list kind of structure would be something to look
;into for future versions. As a quick and dirty solution though this functions fine. (it just might be very expensive to
;manipulate admins later on)

;Super-Admins are distinguish by being on the list at a position less then the "Super admins level" Currently there are no
;additional powers granted to super admins except to modify the super admin level. This feature was left in as a concept
;option. Similarly Normal members have no priveleges in this contract what so ever but since this is intended to be part of a
;DOUG cluster another contract may require require membership to perform actions

;One nice feature of this contract is it is recursive. It will call itself to check permissions of users when modifications are
;to be done
