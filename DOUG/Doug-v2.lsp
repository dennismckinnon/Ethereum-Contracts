;DOUG

;Transactions
;Register: Format: "reg" "name" (maybe name is hexadecimal?)
;DOUG will record name requested at the address of request and create a confirmation request of consensus contract
;When a concensus contract has reached criteria for a successful concensus (or maybe doug will ask everytime he is called)
;in either case once doug recieves the go ahead he will make the swap (this involves changing the address located at name)
;
;Request: Format: "req" "name"
;Request asks Doug for the contract address currently associated with "name" and doug will return it or return 0 if no such 
;name is registered.
;
;Fetch: Format: "fetch" #number
;Fetch will return the [name:Contract ID] pair for the item located in  
;
;when the upgrades name is empty Doug will by default accept all registrations
;
;Structure
;
;Upgrades must always register for slot "conc"
