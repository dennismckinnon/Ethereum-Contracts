;Infohash-Based Database manager
;
;This Contract maintains a database of a small amount of information tied to an infohash (expected to be 20 bytes long)
;which identifies it. All database manipulations (additions deletions) use this infohash to reference the database 
;entry. For every Infohash a total of 32 storage addresses are allocated. One for the infohash and one for the creator
;(tracking the creator is optional but useful) The other 30 slots can be allocated freely however there is build in
;structure that can be used. A database entry has the following form:

;Infohash 		(1 Slot)
;Creator 		(1 Slot)
;Uploader 		(1 Slot)
;File Type 		(1 Slot)
;File quality 	(1 Slot)
;Title 			(2 Slots)
;Description 	(25 Slots)

;1 Slot stores 32 bytes so each of the first 5 fields can store 32 characters each Title can store 64 characters and
;800 characters are allotacted to the description. (creator is not optional and the infohash is tied to this entry 
;so those fields are not actually manipulatable)

;The Add/edit function has the handle "moddbe" (modify database entry) th format for making an addition or edit is:
;Data: "moddbe" 0xInfoHash 0xIndicator <"Uploader","Filetype","File Quality","Title","Description">
;
;0xIndicator provides information as to which the following sequence of data entries are provided (oder must be maintained)
;
;For example and Indicator of 0x10100 would indicate the information being passed is for slots File Quality and Description
;the data for this transaction would have the form:
;"moddbe" 0xInfohash 0x10100 "FileQuality" "Description"
;
;Notice the most significant hex digit corresponds to the latest in the list.
;
;In order to make an addition or and edit you must be at least a normal user as indicated by the user permission manager
;Which is requested from Doug (initially hard coded and then after first run it will be updated dynamically)
;
;There is a modular structure to add/edit which should make it easy to edit the structure of a database entry with ease
;In order to edit an entry which already exists. You must be either that entry's creator or an admin
;
;The other main function is Delete. "deldbe" 0xinfohash will delete all current records associated with that entry.
;Neither of these function are particularly efficient. In future versions a linked list type structure would probably be
;ideal. This is proof of concept so this was not included

;This contract is intended to be part of a Doug-Cluster and gets all permissions from a contract doug identifies as user
;In other words:
;Dependancies:
;-Doug ("doug")
;-User permission manager ("user")
